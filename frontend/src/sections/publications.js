/**
 * publications is an array of objects where each object represents a publication.
 * Each publication object contains the following properties:
 * 
 * - title: A string representing the title of the publication.
 * - url: A string representing the URL to the publication.
 * - summary: (Optional) A string summarizing the publication.
 * - date: (Optional) A string representing the date of the publication.
 * - authors: (Optional) An array of strings representing the authors of the publication.
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * {
 *   title: "Publication Title",
 *   url: "http://example.com/publication",
 *   summary: "This publication is about...",
 *   date: "Year of publication",
 *   authors: ["Author One", "Author Two"],
 * }
 * 
 * To add a new publication, directly alter the publications array by adding a new object
 * with the required properties(title, and url) and the optional properties if available (summary, date, authors).
 * An added publication should follow the same structure as the previous publication objects. 
 *  
 * For example:
 * 
 * {
 *   title: "New Publication Title",
 *   url: "http://newpublication.com",
 *   summary: "This new publication is about...",
 *   date: "New Year of publication",
 *   authors: ["New Author One", "New Author Two"],
 * }
