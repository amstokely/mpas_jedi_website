/**
 * tutorials is an array of objects where each object represents a tutorial.
 * Each tutorial object contains the following properties:
 *
 * - location: A string that represents the location where the tutorial takes place.
 * - date: A string that represents the date of the tutorial, formatted as "Month Year".
 * - url: A string that represents the URL to the tutorial.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * {
 *   location: "NCU",
 *   date: "October 2023",
 *   url: "https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/projects/mpas-jedi/tutorial/202310NCU/",
 * }
 *
 * To add a new tutorial, directly alter the tutorials array by adding a new object
 * with the required properties(location, date, url).
 * An added tutorial should follow the same structure as the previous tutorial objects.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * {
 *   location: "New University",
 *   date: "January 2025",
 *   url: "https://newuniversity.edu/tutorial/202501/",
 * }
